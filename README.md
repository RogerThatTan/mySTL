**Data Structures and Algorithms in C++**
<br>
This repository contains a collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. Each data structure is implemented as a class with various methods for operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

**Single Linked List**
<br>
The SingleLinkedList class represents a singly linked list. It provides methods to insert elements at the beginning, end, or any specified position, delete elements by value or position, and display the list's contents.
<br>
**Double Linked List**
<br>
The DoubleLinkedList class represents a doubly linked list. It provides methods to insert elements at the beginning, end, or any specified position, delete elements by value or position, and display the list's contents.
<br>
**Stack**
<br>
The Stack class implements a basic stack data structure. It provides methods to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and get the top element. The stack is implemented using a linked list.
<br>
**Queue**
<br>
The Queue class implements a basic queue data structure. It provides methods to enqueue elements at the rear, dequeue elements from the front, and get the front and rear elements. The queue is implemented using a linked list.
<br>
**Binary Search Tree (BST)**
<br>
The BST class implements a binary search tree. It provides methods to insert elements, search for elements, and display the tree in various orders (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
<br>
Feel free to modify the code and explore the different operations for each data structure.
